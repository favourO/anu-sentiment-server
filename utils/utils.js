    "Meditation I have been using the free meditation app Oak. I am finding it helpful for clarity. I thought I would just mention it. Hope all are having a good new year.",
"I forgot to take my morning meds. But luckily all my psych meds are at night.  I'm just not sure what to do about the birth control.  My nurse took today off and set out my medication yesterday.",
"Not sure if I'm experiencing thought broadcasting For a while now I've been very quiet in work and when I'm able to have a conversation it's like I'm explaining what",
"Questions regarding my depot. Hey guys, just a quick question. I had my depot injection on the 28th December. After 24hours, the site of the injection (in my arm, Paleperidone) became very red and swollen. 24 hours later there was a grape sized lump which was red, swollen and painful. The redness has since gone down and so has the pain, but the area is still swollen. I’m worried that the fluid hasn’t gone into my muscle and is instead sitting under the skin. The last time I had my depot, I didn’t have any of these symptoms Can anyone give me any advice? Thanks. ",

"Advice on Coming Clean? Hello I am 22 and am beginning a relationship with an 18F from my work. Don't know how to tell her I'm schizophrenic but think I should? What would you do/say? I'm worried to scare her off but I don't want to hide it necessarily. Advice?",

"Brain fog. Does anyone else experience brain fog? That feeling where your brain feels clogged and your eyes feel fuzzy.",
"Anyone on Twitter? I created a twitter account. I found twitter really beneficial in learning what mental health professionals are saying, connecting to advocates, and seeing/reading new articles about schizophrenia.If anyone wants to connect w me there:https://mobile.twitter.com/blog_SRG",

"My NY's resolution is to be a better version of myself For the past two years I felt crippled by trauma and this terrible disease. Everything I valued about myself seemed to have disappeared. I didn't know who I was anymore. I became a black hole of negativity, a selfish person who couldn't get out of her own head. Everyday was like torture. I'd wake up in pain and go to bed in pain, and spend every moment in between thinking about ending it. The guilt, the shame, the grief, the anger, the self-disgust was overwhelming. I ended up in the hospital over and over again, but nothing changed, and it felt like nothing would ever change. I was broken and unfixable.But that wasn't true. Something clicked halfway through 2017. Through a combination of supportive friends, family, professionals, and the right medication, I found a dim light that grew brighter each morning. More than that, I found myself again. Not the same exact person I used to be before all of this - but a new, improved version of it. My resolution is to keep improving on that person throughout 2018. I know by doing that it will already make it a much better year than the last.Happy New Year. What are your resolutions?",

"Does socializing make your mental health worse? Not in a work context, but say in an after-work coworker outing? Or an outing with anyone? People like me at first, they invite me out, but then they will slowly abandon me. The only people who still hang with me on a limited basis, I'm pretty sure, are people who have tagged me as a charity case. Not a genuine friendship. Plus I might have some aspergers.",

"I keep hurting people i can't stop hurting people and being cruel or lashing out to try and make them leave. i know they're gonna leave anyway and it feels like i have to test them because i know they'll break at some point. i know they all talk about in secret behind my back, and i know they want to trip me up and catch me out, and unpick me at the seams and let me spill across the floor, even when their names aren't yellow they want me gone deep down even if they don't realise it. i'm a drain on everybody around me, and it seems like it might be wise to just end myself instead of lashing out at them all the time. i don't know how to be or exist or survive; being gone seems like the most peaceful route. i can't stop myself from tearing everything apart, and their plots grow by the day.",

"I don't know what to say... The girl I'm dating went on a 2 hour rant about how something that happened 2 years ago at a school is still following her. They gave her father a stroke and made sure her grandmother had bad nursing in her home. She's afraid to go to ANY Dr for fear they will be contacted by said medical school and give her false information on purpose. She's afraid to get lasic eye surgery for the same reason, they will blind her on purpose...I have no idea what to say to these things... it\'s completely insane.",

"Is anyone else's Voices just an intrusive thought that talks I do hear voices but only on my worst episodes mostly its just an intrusive thought that talks.",

"Conflicting thoughts I just want to give up.  Medication side effects are kicking my ass.  I won't find a girlfriend. I wont be able to live on my own.  I wont be able to get a job I like.  I can't find a medication that doesn't have side effects.  I hate schizophrenia.  I hate that I had to get it.  I feel like I am getting my ass kicked.  I have less energy than before.  I feel lazy.  I feel depressed. Everything will be fine. I will find the right medication. I will be able to get a girlfriend. I will find love.  I will find the right job.  I can still do whatever I want.  I will be able to achieve my goals.  I will be able to accomplish everything.",

"I want to give in I want to talk to the man in the lightbulb so badly. I might watch a movie and talk to him, would it hurt my psyche if I had even the smallest communication with him?",

"Feeling kinda lost I'm scared that my body's internal clock is not working anymore and that I won't be able to sleep if I stop taking my clozapine. I don't know what to do really and sometimes feel like I need to be fearful or paranoid to exist now since all of my voices left a year ago when I started taking the medication.  My doc has been helping me lower my dose for the past 3 months too. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this?Thanks and hope you all have a brighter new year!",

"STOP POISONING MY SHIT! okay legitimately can whoever's poisoning my water and air in my house stop. i'm getting legitimately sick and i have pimples and im always cold and tired and i don't know why they're trying to damage my health. it's so unfair how do i filter my air and water? i'm so tired and angry at whoever's doing this. none of my family seems to be aware of the poison.",

"Fatigue What do you all do for the fatigue? Mines been increasingly worse lately and I’m just wondering if anyone else has any advice. Well if you get the fatigue that is.",

"Had a rough day I had a rough day today. Things were going great, my husband and I went out for lunch for new years. until I slipped in the parking lot. But to know the full extent you have to know what happened a year and a half ago. As many of you may know I had a very serious suicide attempt in sept of 2016 that left me with serious left leg damage (on top of other things but this is what relates to the story) Well I live in Upstate New York so its snowing now so the parking lot was icy and full of snow so I slipped and fell right on my ankle that was already damaged. It hurt so bad I went into shock, all I could do was laugh (and I have a high pain tolerance) We went to an urgent care, waited for an hour, turns out nothing is broken! But I have a serious sprain.  It hurts so bad and it reminds me of how I felt when I got out of the hospital a year and a half ago. Im stuck on crutches for at least 2 weeks. There goes starting my new year off right.",

"I hate my life I really hate my life. It has been so fucking weird. Like some kind of greek tragedy. I can't fucking believe it it's so unfair. I actually give a shit about other people and what not but everyone I know has betrayed me in some way. Or just been a complete asshole for the short duration that I knew them. I can't deal with it it's so fucked up.",

"Longest psychotic episode What’s the longest psychotic episode you’ve ever had?",

"Happy New Year everyone! How did you/are you spending it? Alone? With others? Discontent? Happy? Alone for me, well with my parents but it's a first to not have something to do. I suppose that's a trend which won't be changing for years to come."
